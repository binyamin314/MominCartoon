            "Orphaned in his younger years, he is a somewhat restless soul who left the orphanage to venture out into the world in his youth but has now settled down, determined to be a responsible father to his family.",
            "The calm mother, who takes care that Moominhouse is a safe place to be. She wants everyone to be happy, appreciates individuality, but settles things when someone is wronged. She always brings good food as well as whatever else may be necessary on a journey in her handbag.",
            "Moomin's friend. She is happy and energetic, but often suddenly changes her mind on things. She loves nice clothes and jewelry and is a little flirtatious. She thinks of herself as Moomin's girlfriend.",
            "Snorkmaiden's brother. He is an introvert by nature and is always inventing things. The residents of Moominvalley often ask Snork for help solving tricky problems and building machines. Snorks are like moomintrolls, but change colour according to their mood.",
            "Moomin's best friend. The lonesome philosophical traveller, who likes to play the harmonica and wanders around the world with only a few things, so as not to make his life complicated. He always comes and goes as he pleases, is carefree and has many admirers in Moominvalley. He is also shown to be quite fearless and calm in even the most dire situations, which has proven to be a great help to Moomintroll and the others when in danger.",
            "A creature who lives in the Moomin house. He likes to take part in everything, but is afraid to do anything dangerous. Sniff appreciates all valuables and makes many plans to get rich, but does not succeed.",
            "A mischievous little girl, who lives in the Moomin house and has a brave, spunky personality. She likes adventure, but loves catastrophes, and often does mean things on purpose. She finds messiness and untidiness exciting and is very down to earth when others are not.",
            "An elderly man from the Hamil breed (named after the breed) who collects. At first he collected stamps, when he collected all the stamps in the world, he moved to collecting flowers of all kinds and finally moved to the field of ornithology. A kind-hearted man who is a little unhappy because of Serah's incessant evil antics. We are bound to help Momin and Snorka in any trouble. Maintains regular contact with the New Plants Association and tries to register his discoveries there. He was twice honored for discovering two rare plants in the Moomin Valley, which were named after him.",
            "Joins as the new neighbor to the Moomin Valley. A rigid and cold woman who educates her three children with extreme rigidity. She is afraid of her children learning bad habits, and always worries when they play more enthusiastically. Mrs. Philpionk wants the manner of obeying her rules and principles to be absolute. Even the smallest failure depresses her, and she is comfortable getting angry. Although Mrs. Philpionk is responsible and obedient to the maximum degree, deep down she may be a little jealous of the free and carefree lives of the believers.",
            "A small and pesky creature, most of his occupation is pranks which he performs on the inhabitants of the valley. He does this out of malice - he really enjoys driving people crazy and stealing things, but he is always found out. His other hobbies include eavesdropping, vandalism and interfering with police operations. Serah is very proud of his reputation as a rogue, and will do anything to maintain it. Because of his antics, people try not to invite him to parties and do not include him in any other activity - but for some reason he shows up uninvited anyway. Sarge is a bit stupid, and thinks only of himself. He will steal anything, but prefers valuables. He does cause quite a bit of trouble, but the members of the Momin family are quite amused by the fact that they know a real criminal.",
            "A cold and lonely monster. Everything around her turns into a block of ice. She is not fundamentally evil, and is always looking for company and warmth, but due to her appearance, she causes reluctance to face her. She usually sits on burning fires to warm herself, which immediately causes her to go out. Reminiscent of Papi in her form and behavior.",
            "Strange, white, stick-shaped creatures with small hands, which grow from special seeds planted on a midsummer night. The shamanteps are creatures that generate electricity, and are charged by the lightning on cold winter nights when a lightning storm strikes the ancient cedar tree at the top of the Solitude Mountains, their gathering place. Those who approach them are electrocuted, therefore they are considered to be those creatures that must be kept at a distance from them. They have a barometer that hangs on a lightning pole that tells them when a lightning storm is approaching, where they gather to recharge."};
